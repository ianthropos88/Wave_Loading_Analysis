/*
Description:
A delivery document is the central object in the logistic execution process, which allows documenting and tracking activities such as delivery scheduling, 
picking and packing.

This dataset provides a consolidated view on Delivery - both inbound and outbound delivery information for Seeds. Additionally, 
it contains the delivery conditions (for Products/Foundation), which provides the transport surcharges, etc.

Dataset -  provides the following details:

Who and What– who are the delivery partners, what is the type of delivery,  which material,  batch, quantities, delivery conditions, etc.
When and Where – What dates - for delivery, goods issue/receipt, picking, packing, etc and which plants, Shipping/receiving points.
